## Why This Documentation Exists

This documentation exists to:

- explain how to install, configure, and operate Codee-maintained extensions,
- keep configuration examples and gotchas in one searchable place,
- provide pragmatic, implementation-focused guides.

## Who It's For

- Developers building on Medusa.js and related tooling
- Integrators / agencies implementing client projects
- Contributors who maintain or extend Codee packages

## Who Maintains It

This documentation is maintained by the **Codee Team**. Source of truth lives in GitHub (issues and pull requests are welcome):

- [github.com/codee-sh](https://github.com/codee-sh)

## How It Will Evolve

- We keep docs aligned with the latest stable releases; pages include compatibility notes when relevant.
- Missing, outdated, or unclear docs are treated as a bug: report it as an issue or propose a fix via PR.
- Coverage will expand as we release more modules/plugins and as OpenMercato matures.
